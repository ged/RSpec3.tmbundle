# RSpec 3 TextMate 2 Bundle

I got frustrated with the regular RSpec bundle, which wasn't really ported to work with TextMate 2, and for which I was carrying around a huge list of deltas.

I'm planning on making this a pretty simple bundle that just includes some basic stuff that I use every day like a spec runner, the file-switcher thing, and a grammar that's updated for RSpec 3. It's for myself, but if it ends up being useful for you too, then I'll happily accept pull requests; I only ask that you follow the conventions already in the code. I know I'm a weirdo and use ["smart tabs"][smart-tabs] and so should be crucified with all the BSD weirdos, but [I started writing Ruby in 2001][mues] and had a good six years of habit and thousands of lines of code I'd have to redo before Rails came along and decided that 2-space indent was the One True Wayâ„¢.

This bundle borrows the preferences and a bit of the language grammar from the RSpec2 bundle by Florian Weber and the RSpec team. Many thanks to them for the original.
